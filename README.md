In this structure, there are three main directories:

__data/__: This directory contains the training and validation data. The data is organized into subdirectories, one for each class.

__models/__: This directory contains the model files. Each model is defined in a separate Python file.

__experiments/__: This directory contains subdirectories for each experiment. Each experiment has a configuration file (__config.yaml__), a training script (__train.py__), and a testing script (__test.py__). The configuration file specifies the hyperparameters and other settings for the experiment.

The __utils/__ directory contains utility scripts and functions for working with the data and models.
